# Quick Start: Platform Connection

Get started connecting your social media platforms in 5 minutes.

## What is Platform Connection?

Platform Connection lets you:
- Connect multiple social media accounts in one place
- Post to multiple platforms simultaneously
- Manage all your accounts from a single dashboard
- Schedule content across different platforms

## Step 1: Navigate to Settings

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
2. Select **Settings**
3. You'll see the "Connected Accounts" section

## Step 2: Connect Your First Platform

1. Click on the **Available Platforms** tab
2. Find the platform you want to connect (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
3. Click the **"Connect with OAuth"** button
4. You'll be redirected to that platform to authorize

## Step 3: Authorize on the Platform

**For Twitter (X)**:
1. Log in with your Twitter account (if not already logged in)
2. Review the permissions requested
3. Click **"Authorize"** to grant access
4. You'll be redirected back to the app

**For Other Platforms**:
- Follow the same authorization flow on that platform

## Step 4: Confirm Your Connection

After authorization:
- You'll be returned to the app automatically
- Your account will appear in the "Your Connected Accounts" list
- Status will show as **Active** (green checkmark)

## Step 5: Test Your Connection (Optional)

1. Find your new account in the list
2. Click the **"Test"** button to verify it works
3. You'll see a success message if everything is working

## Common Tasks

### Connect Another Account on Same Platform

1. Go back to **Available Platforms** tab
2. Click **"Connect with OAuth"** again on the same platform
3. If you have multiple accounts on that platform, select a different one during authorization
4. That account will now appear in your list

### Disconnect an Account

1. Find the account in your "Connected Accounts" list
2. Click the **trash icon** on the right
3. Confirm you want to disconnect
4. The account is immediately removed

### Check Account Status

1. Look for the **green checkmark** or **warning icon** next to each account
2. Green checkmark = Active and working
3. Warning icon = Credentials may need attention
4. Click **"Test"** to verify

### View Platform Status

1. Stay on the "Your Accounts" tab
2. See statistics at the top:
   - **Total Accounts**: All connected accounts
   - **Active Accounts**: Working accounts
   - **Needs Attention**: Accounts with issues

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Failed to connect account"
- Solution: Check your internet connection and try again
- Make sure you're using the correct account on the platform

**Problem**: "Connection test failed"
- Solution: Try disconnecting and reconnecting the account
- The platform may have revoked permissions

**Problem**: "Account shows as Inactive"
- Solution: Click "Test" to verify credentials
- If test fails, disconnect and reconnect

**Problem**: "I don't see my platform"
- Solution: Some platforms are "Coming Soon"
- Check back later for new platform support

## Next Steps

### Publishing Content

Once you have platforms connected:
1. Create a new post
2. Select which account(s) to publish to
3. Schedule or publish immediately
4. Your content goes to all selected platforms

### Managing Multiple Accounts

You can:
- Connect multiple accounts per platform
- Set a "default" account for quick posting
- Switch accounts when creating content
- See all accounts in your dashboard

### Monitoring Performance

1. Use the **Platform Connection Dashboard** to:
   - See real-time connection status
   - Monitor which accounts are active
   - Check recent activity
   - View statistics

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Test connections regularly to ensure they're working
- Keep your platform passwords secure
- Disconnect accounts you no longer use
- Check status before important posts

❌ **Don't**:
- Share your authorization links
- Use the same account name for multiple platforms
- Leave inactive connections for extended periods
- Post sensitive content without checking all accounts

## Security

Your credentials are:
- **Encrypted** with 256-bit security
- **Never shared** with third parties
- **Only used** to access your platforms
- **Stored securely** on our servers

We follow best practices for OAuth 2.0 authentication and never store your passwords.
